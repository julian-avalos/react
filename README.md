This is my first try at creating a React app.
## Roadmap
1. The first step is to create a personal single page site using normal static HTML / CSS.
2. After that I plan on on utilizing Foundation for HTML and SASS for CSS.
3. This will then grow to include multiple pages.
4. Finally, I plan on integrating dynamic content
